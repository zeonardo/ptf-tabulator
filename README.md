# Luiz Leonardo Lima: PowerToFly Coding Challenge

  

![Expected screen output](/src/assets/tablulator.png)

  

## Required Tasks

  
1. ✅ Implement Tab and TabPane components
2. ✅ Support uncontrolled and controlled modes in parallel

## Bonus Tasks

1. ✅ Implement another version of *Tab* which renders each pane just once.
2. ⚠️ Update types to prevent out-of-bound *active* / *initialActive* values (if it's technically possible)
3. ✅ Write tests for your component(s).
4. ⏳ Publish your component as an NPM library. Make sure it can be used in a TypeScript-based project.


## Assumptions

- Tabulator... is Tabs!(?)
- Tab content can be any text or HTML
- Colors and styles were simplified for this challenge

## Available Scripts


In the project directory, you can run:

  

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

  

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes to the code.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

 

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

  

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

 Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
